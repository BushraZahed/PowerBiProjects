I have created a report by following the reference : https://youtu.be/pixlHHe_lNQ
The project deals with survey data from various countries and age groups. The survey includes questionannire about worklife balance, about current job role and education, salary and difficulty level to land a job.
In powerbi, I have created a report/dashboard that shows relationships between various data columns.
